# Uber-Stock-Tracker
This project involves using the Yahoo Finance API to track the stock price of UBER, a ride-hailing company. The project provides real-time updates on the UBER stock price and allows users to monitor changes in the stock price over time.

## Yahoo Finance API

The Yahoo Finance API is used to retrieve real-time data on the UBER stock price. The API provides access to a wide range of financial data, including historical stock prices, company financials, and market news.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Yfinance
* Plotly

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and run the stock tracker.ipynb file.

The script will use the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve the real-time UBER stock price and display it on the console. The script can be run continuously to monitor changes in the stock price over time.

## Results
The script provides real-time updates on the UBER stock price, allowing users to monitor changes in the stock price over time. Users can also use the data retrieved from the Yahoo Finance API to perform further analysis, such as calculating the average stock price over a specific time period.

## Future Improvements
In the future, the project can be further expanded to include additional features, such as graphical representation of the stock price data and alerts for significant changes in the stock price. The project can also be extended to track the stock prices of other companies and provide a comparative analysis of their performance.
